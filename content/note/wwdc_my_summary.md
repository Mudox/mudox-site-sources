There has been hundreds of WWDC session videos on [Apple WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/), which provide first-hand knowledges about iOS development from Apple's engineers' perspective.

Here records progressively my summaries after watching, mainly about the order and prerequisites of watching parts of them.

For those who are new to it, I highly recommend the [ASCIIwwdc](http://asciiwwdc.com/) website.
