# Class Like Constructs In Swift

In Swift, `enum`, `struct`, `class` all can:

1. have __properties__ to keep states.

2. have __methods__ to perform actions.

3. define __subscript__ operators to let user access their properties through
   subscript syntax.

4. define __initializers__ to have a reasonable initial state.

5. be __extended__ to have additional behaviors beyond their default implementations.

6. conform to __protocols__.

Only `class` can:

1. have __inheritance__ capability.

2. have __deinitializer__.

3. be __referenced__ by mutiple variable or constants. the `struct` and `enum`
   are both value types.

# Properties

## stored properties

### lazy properties

## computed properties

### shorthand setter syntax

### shorthand read-only getter syntax

# Initializers
