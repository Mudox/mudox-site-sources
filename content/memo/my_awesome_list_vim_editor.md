# Test & CI

+ [vim-vspec](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec)

    The old one, using RSpec syntax, needs some external dependencies

+ [vader.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim)

    A simple Vimscript test framework written by
    [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)'s author
    [junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn).
    It is the test framework I am using currently, it's neat and of pure VimL

+ [lua testing framework used by Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

    Based on the lua's test framework [busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/),
    Neovim community have been using it for testing the Neovim project. When
    the [lua-client](https://github.com/neovim/lua-client) comes to mature, it
    will be published to Neovim plugin authors. I am looking forward to it.

+ [neomake](https://github.com/benekastah/neomake)

    A plugin for asynchronous :make using Neovim's job-control functionality
